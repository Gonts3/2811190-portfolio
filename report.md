In this lab i learned to create a repository, clone it to my local machine and work on my HTLM portfolio. I learned of semantic HTML elements. It was my first time seeing that you could add a footer on HTML and it looks cool with my details on it. The biggest challenge i had was with GitHub and navigating my way through it but i got it at the end espacially working with branches.
